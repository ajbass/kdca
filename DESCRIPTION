Description: Identifying differential co-expression in gene expression studies with Kernel-based Differential Co-expression Analysis (KDCA). KDCA is a flexible kernel-based approach that leverages multiple genes in a pathway to discover differential co-expression in a microarray or RNA-seq study. KDCA can test one or more risk factors while accounting for covariates, batch effects, and variance-specific effects (i.e., common sources of bias in differential co-exprerssion analysis).
